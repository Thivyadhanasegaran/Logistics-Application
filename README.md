# Logistics Application

## Problem Statement:
Customers often lack visibility into the detailed stages of the packing and shipping process, making it challenging for them to track the status of their packages. In the event of a delay or issue within the logistics, customs, cargo, or on-ground processes, customers are left uninformed about the specific stage where their package might be stalled or lost.

There is a need to establish a **transparent** and **accessible tracking system** that empowers customers with real-time updates, providing clarity on the progression of their packages and alerting them promptly if any disruptions occur, thus enhancing overall customer satisfaction and trust.
