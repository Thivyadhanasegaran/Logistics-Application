# Logistics-Application

Problem Statement:

Customers often lack visibility into the detailed stages of the packing and shipping process, making it 
challenging for them to track the status of their packages. In the event of a delay or issue within the logistics, 
customs, cargo, or on-ground processes, customers are left uninformed about the specific stage where their package 
might be stalled or lost. There is a need to establish a transparent and accessible tracking system that empowers 
customers with real-time updates, providing clarity on the progression of their packages and alerting them promptly 
if any disruptions occur, thus enhancing overall customer satisfaction and trust.
